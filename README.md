> A simple to use API interface to help get you off the ground quickly and efficiently with your Elastic Path Commerce Cloud JavaScript apps.

üìö [API reference](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/commerce-cloud/docs/developer/get-started/sdk.html#officially-supported-sdk) &mdash; üìö [Elastic Path Commerce Cloud](https://www.elasticpath.com)

## üõ† Installation

Install the package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moltin/sdk) and import in your project.

```bash
npm install --save @moltin/sdk
```

## ‚õΩÔ∏è Usage

To get started, instantiate a new Moltin client with your store credentials.

> **Note:** This requires an [Elastic Path Commerce Cloud](https://www.elasticpath.com) account.

```js
// JavaScript
import { gateway as MoltinGateway } from '@moltin/sdk'

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX'
})

// Node.js
const MoltinGateway = require('@moltin/sdk').gateway

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX',
  client_secret: 'XXX'
})
```

Alternatively you can include the `UMD` bundle via [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com) like so:

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@moltin/sdk"></script>

<script>
  const Moltin = moltin.gateway({
    client_id: 'XXX'
  });
</script>
```

> **Note:** If you're using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io), you'll need to add the following to your projects configuration file.

```js
node: {
  fs: 'empty'
}
```

You can now authenticate with the Moltin service üéâ

```js
Moltin.Authenticate().then(response => {
  console.log('authenticated', response)
})
```

Check out the [API reference](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/commerce-cloud/docs/api/index.html) to learn more about authenticating and the available endpoints.

### Custom Host

If you're an enterprise customer with your own infrastructure, you'll need to specify your API URL when instantiating:

```js
const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX',
  host: 'api.yourdomain.com'
})
```

### Custom Storage

By default the Elastic Path Commerce Cloud SDK persists data to `window.localStorage` in the browser and `node-localstorage` in Node. If this doesn't suit your needs you can override the default storage with a `MemoryStorageFactory` which will persist data for the life cycle of the JavaScript VM:

```js
import { gateway as MoltinGateway, MemoryStorageFactory } from '@moltin/sdk'

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX',
  storage: new MemoryStorageFactory()
});
```

Or alternatively, create your own storage factory by passing in an object which implements the following interface:

```js
interface StorageFactory {
  set(key: string, value: string): void;
  get(key: string): string | null;
  delete(key: string): void;
}
```

### Included Headers

There are currently several optional headers you can pass into the configuration, which include `application`, `language` and `currency`.

You can pass them into the config used by the gateway like this:

```
// JavaScript
import { gateway as MoltinGateway } from '@moltin/sdk'
// const MoltinGateway = require('@moltin/sdk').gateway -> for Node

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
    client_id: 'XXX',
    client_secret: 'XXX'
    currency: 'YEN',
    language: 'en',
    application: 'my-app'
})

``` 
### TypeScript Support
The Moltin SDK is fully supported in Typescript. Each service is wrapped in a namespace which exposes all the necessary interfaces and endpoints that can be consumed.

The majority of responses will be returned as either a `Response` (single object returned) or a `ResponsePage` (an array of items) - see `src/types/core.d.ts` for more info.

Current exposed namespaces include `address`, `brand`, `cart`, `category`, `collection`, `core`, `currencies`, `customer`, `field`, `flow`, `integration`, `inventory`, `job`, `order`, `product` and `transaction`. For further information on any of these services, please refer to the [documentation](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/commerce-cloud/docs/api).

You can consume any of the interfaces by importing the namespace into your project. eg:

```
import { product } from '@moltin/sdk';

const product: product.ProductBase = {...}
```

If you do not want to use the namespace, you can extend the interfaces and define them yourself, like so:

```
// You can name the interface anything you like
interface Product extends product.ProductBase {
}

const product: Product = {...}
```

Here is an example of a simple product creation:

```
import { Moltin, gateway, product, Resource } from '@moltin/sdk';

async function main() {
    const g: Moltin = gateway({client_id, client_secret});
    const auth = await g.Authenticate();
    
    const newProduct: product.ProductBase = {
        type: "product",
        name: "My Product",
        slug: "my-prod",
        sku: "my-prod",
        manage_stock: false,
        description: "Some description",
        status: "draft",
        commodity_type: "physical",
        price: [
            {
                amount: 5499,
                currency: "USD",
                includes_tax: true
            }
        ]
    };
    
    const nP: Resource<Product> = await g.Products.Create(newProduct);
}
```

You can also extend any base interface compatible with flows to create any custom interfaces that you might be using.

```
interface CustomProduct extends product.ProductBase {
    customFlowField?: string
}

const newProduct: CustomProduct = {
    type: "product",
    name: "My Product",
    slug: "my-prod",
    sku: "my-prod",
    customFlowField: "My custome flow..."
    manage_stock: false,
    description: "Some description",
    status: "draft",
    commodity_type: "physical",
    price: [
        {
            amount: 5499,
            currency: "USD",
            includes_tax: true
        }
    ]
};
``` 

You can cast these custom interfaces on any of the endpoints, to ensure you expose the custom fields. 

```
const customProduct: Resource<CustomProduct> = await g.Products.Create<CustomProduct>(newProduct);

console.log(`New Flow Product`, customProduct.data.customWeight); // this will pass!
```

You can also consume `filters`, `sorts` and `includes` from relevant services, to ensure you are querying the API correctly.

eg: 

```
const filter: product.ProductFilter  = {
    like: {
        name: '...'
    }
}

const filteredProduct = await g.Products.Filter(filter)
```

```
npm install
npm start
```
