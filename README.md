> A simple to use API interface to help get you off the ground quickly and efficiently with your Elastic Path Commerce Cloud JavaScript apps.

üìö [API reference](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/commerce-cloud/docs/developer/get-started/sdk.html#officially-supported-sdk) &mdash; üìö [Elastic Path Commerce Cloud](https://www.elasticpath.com)

## üõ† Installation

Install the package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moltin/sdk) and import in your project.

```bash
npm install --save @moltin/sdk
```

## ‚õΩÔ∏è Usage

To get started, instantiate a new Moltin client with your store credentials.

> **Note:** This requires an [Elastic Path Commerce Cloud](https://www.elasticpath.com) account.

```js
// JavaScript
import { gateway as MoltinGateway } from '@moltin/sdk'

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX'
})

// Node.js
const MoltinGateway = require('@moltin/sdk').gateway

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX',
  client_secret: 'XXX'
})
```

Alternatively you can include the `UMD` bundle via [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com) like so:

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@moltin/sdk"></script>

<script>
  const Moltin = moltin.gateway({
    client_id: 'XXX'
  });
</script>
```

> **Note:** If you're using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io), you'll need to add the following to your projects configuration file.

```js
node: {
  fs: 'empty'
}
```

You can now authenticate with the Moltin service üéâ

```js
Moltin.Authenticate().then(response => {
  console.log('authenticated', response)
})
```

Check out the [API reference](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/commerce-cloud/docs/api/index.html) to learn more about authenticating and the available endpoints.

### Custom Host

If you're an enterprise customer with your own infrastructure, you'll need to specify your API URL when instantiating:

```js
const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX',
  host: 'api.yourdomain.com'
})
```

### Custom Storage

By default the Elastic Path Commerce Cloud SDK persists data to `window.localStorage` in the browser and `node-localstorage` in Node. If this doesn't suit your needs you can override the default storage with a `MemoryStorageFactory` which will persist data for the life cycle of the JavaScript VM:

```js
import { gateway as MoltinGateway, MemoryStorageFactory } from '@moltin/sdk'

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
  client_id: 'XXX',
  storage: new MemoryStorageFactory()
})
```

Or alternatively, create your own storage factory by passing in an object which implements the following interface:

```js
interface StorageFactory {
  set(key: string, value: string): void;
  get(key: string): string | null;
  delete(key: string): void;
}
```

### Included Headers

There are currently several optional headers you can pass into the configuration, which include `application`, `language` and `currency`.

You can pass them into the config used by the gateway like this:

```
// JavaScript
import { gateway as MoltinGateway } from '@moltin/sdk'
// const MoltinGateway = require('@moltin/sdk').gateway -> for Node

const Moltin = MoltinGateway({
    client_id: 'XXX',
    client_secret: 'XXX'
    currency: 'YEN',
    language: 'en',
    application: 'my-app'
})
```

### Handling File Upload

Files can be uploaded to the EPCC file service with the `Moltin.Files.Create` method. You should pass a `FormData` object as described in the [documentation](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/commerce-cloud/docs/api/advanced/files/create-a-file.html#post-create-a-file 'documentation').

In a Node.js environment, where you may be using an alternative `FormData` implementation, you can include a second parameter to represent the `Content-Type` header for the request. This must be `multipart/form-data` and must include a `boundary`. For example, using the `form-data` [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-data 'package'):

```
const FormData = require('form-data')
const formData = new FormData()
formData.append('file', buffer)

const contentType = formData.getHeaders()['content-type']

Moltin.Files.Create(formData, contentType)
```

#### Referencing a file stored elsewhere

If you want to create a file by simply [referencing](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/commerce-cloud/docs/api/advanced/files/create-a-file.html#post-create-a-file 'referencing') a file stored elsewhere, you can use this helper method:

```
Moltin.Files.Link('https://cdn.external-host.com/files/filename.png')
```

Just pass the URL to the `Link` method and creation will be handled for you.

### TypeScript Support

The Elastic Path Commerce Cloud JavaScript SDK is fully supported in Typescript.

Imported module will contain all interfaces needed to consume backend services. i.e:

```TypeScript
import * as moltin from '@moltin/sdk';

const product: moltin.ProductBase = {...}
```

If you do not want to use the namespace, you can extend the interfaces and define them yourself, like so:

```TypeScript
// You can name the interface anything you like
interface Product extends product.ProductBase {
}

const product: Product = {...}
```

Here is an example of a simple product creation:

```TypeScript
import { Moltin, gateway, ProductBase, Resource } from '@moltin/sdk';

async function main() {
  const g: Moltin = gateway({client_id, client_secret});
  const auth = await g.Authenticate();

  const newProduct: ProductBase = {
    type: "product",
    name: "My Product",
    slug: "my-prod",
    sku: "my-prod",
    manage_stock: false,
    description: "Some description",
    status: "draft",
    commodity_type: "physical",
    price: [
      {
        amount: 5499,
        currency: "USD",
        includes_tax: true
      }
    ]
  };

  const nP: Resource<Product> = await g.Products.Create(newProduct);
}
```

You can also extend any base interface compatible with flows to create any custom interfaces that you might be using by re-declaring `@moltin/sdk` module. Following example adds several properties to `ProductsBase` interface that correspond to flows added to the backend.

In your project add a definition file (with a `.d.ts` extension) with a following code:

```TypeScript
import * as moltin from '@moltin/sdk';

declare module '@moltin/sdk' {

  interface Weight {
    g: number;
    kg: number;
    lb: number;
    oz: number;
  }

  interface ProductBase {
    background_color: string;
    background_colour: string | null;
    bulb: string;
    bulb_qty: string;
    finish: string;
    material: string;
    max_watt: string;
    new: string | null;
    on_sale: string | null;
    weight: Weight;
  }

}
```

This will affect base interface and all other Product interfaces that inherit from base interface so added properties will be present when creating, updating, fetching products.

```
npm install
npm start
```

To run test

```
npm test
```
